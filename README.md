# About #

This is a low-contrast color scheme based on [zenburn][1] by Colin T.A. Gray. I found zenburn lacking proper highlights for Markdown and decided to resolve that. Using some other schemes as an inspiration, I've made this one.

If you like this scheme and want to improve it, please open a pull request. As long as the style of it stays the same. Or, if you hate some features of it, you should definitely open an issue and I will look into it.
